.box {
    width: 300px; 
    height: 300px; 
    box-shadow: 10px 10px lightgray;
    background-color: rgb(255, 80, 80);
    border-radius: 10px;
}

/*This task took me about 10 minutes. 
Making and stylizing the red box was easy. However, figuring out how to use the box-shadow property and what parameters to use took a couple of attempts.*/
